        I'm a double major in Computer Science and Digital Narrative and
        Interactive Design with a minor in Information Science at the University
        of Pittsburgh, combining technical skills in coding and software
        development with storytelling and interactive design. My studies allow
        me to explore on how digital media, such as games, shape our experiences
        and influence society, culture, and human behavior.
        <br /><br />
        As a Student Technical Consultant at the University, I assist students
        and faculty with technical troubleshooting and support. Additionally, I
        work as a Barista, where I've honed my customer service, multitasking,
        and time-management skills. I will also be conducting research at Pitt's
        Resilient Systems and Societies Lab under Dr. Amy Babay, where I will
        focus on modeling critical infrastructure resilience against compound
        threats, such as natural disasters and cyberattacks, and designing
        adaptive system architectures to improve recovery and adaptability.
        <br /><br />
        I am passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity,
        particularly in fields like game development, interactive art, and
        creative coding. I enjoy using my technical expertise to craft engaging,
        story-driven experiences and experiment with innovative forms of
        interactive media.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to my work in interactive design and storytelling, I have a
        strong interest in computer networking. I am particularly fascinated by
        how systems communicate and interact, as well as the design and
        implementation of network architectures that support efficiency,
        scalability, and resilience. These distinct areas of interest reflect my
        curiosity for both the creative and technical sides of computing.
