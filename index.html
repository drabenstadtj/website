      <p>
        I am currently a double major in Computer Science and Digital Narrative
        and Interactive Design (DNID) at the University of Pittsburgh. My
        studies allow me to blend technical proficiency in coding and software
        development with creative storytelling and interactive design. This
        interdisciplinary approach empowers me to explore how technologies such
        as games, virtual reality, and digital media can create engaging and
        meaningful user experiences.
        <br /><br />
        As a Student Technical Consultant at the University, I assist students
        and faculty with technical troubleshooting and support. Additionally, I
        work as a Barista, where I've honed my customer service, multitasking,
        and time-management skills. My upcoming research focuses on modeling
        critical infrastructure resilience against compound threats like natural
        disasters and cyberattacks, designing adaptive system architectures for
        improved recovery and adaptability.
        <br /><br />
        I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and
        storytelling, particularly in the field of game development. My goal is
        to create immersive, story-driven experiences that push the boundaries
        of interactive media.
